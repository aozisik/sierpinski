# Sierpiński Fractal

A very simple HTML & Vanilla JS implementation of the Sierpiński triangle.

From Wikipedia:


> The Sierpinski triangle may be constructed from an equilateral triangle by repeated removal of triangular subsets:
> Start with an equilateral triangle.
> Subdivide it into four smaller congruent equilateral triangles and remove the central triangle.
> Repeat step 2 with each of the remaining smaller triangles infinitely.
> Each removed triangle (a trema) is topologically an open set.[1] This process of recursively removing triangles is an example of a finite subdivision rule.
